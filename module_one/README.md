# Module 1

This project contains all my projects from Week 1-12 of my FullStack web dev course on https://epicode.com/. 
This is the frontend module.
The months are split into 3 units, which have 4 weeks each, respectively.

I have converted them all into a Typescript React App. However, I have not edited my initial work, 
beyond _converting the basic HTML files into TSX components (edit later)_.
Alternatively, you can view the unedited projects by checking out any of the Unit repositories on my Github profile!

Here is a breakdown of the site:

You can view each day by navigating to Unit #, Week #
and clicking the chevrons on the side of the pages to navigate between each day of the week.

Although some weeks there are 5 projects, one for each day, a few weeks only have 4, or even 3 projects.
This is due to holidays/no projects assigned/the assignment was research etc.

Build weeks are a team effort, displaying all our learnt skills from the previous weeks of the unit
and collaborating with a new team each build week.

Unit 1:
Week 1 - HTML & CSS
Week 2 - Intro to Javascript
Week 3 - JS Dom
Week 4 - Build week - Quiz project

Unit 2:
Week 5 - Advanced CSS
Week 6 - Intro to Bootstrap
Week 7 - Advanced JS techniques
Week 8 - Build week - Netflix clone

Unit 3:

Week 2 - Advanced React techniques
Week 3 - Redux and Typescript
Week 4 - Build week - LinkedIn Clone

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
